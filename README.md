Create mermaid based flowcharts easily

https://youtu.be/PHwF8MXnWNI

Well, I have always been fascinated with flowcharts and the like. I have always wondered how did they do that?

Thanks to mermaid I have been able to create this webapp to enable one to create flowcharts easily including connections.

Just download the attached file and double click the index.html file and create your flowcharts. These are saved to an indexedb database on your
browser. The flowcharts can be exported to PNG too.

Credits have been included in the About section of the app.

Ta!
